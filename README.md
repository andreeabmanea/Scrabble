The game of Scrabble is implemented in Java in the following way:
 - We used OOP Principles for creating necessary classes for the game: Board, Letter, LetterHolder, LetterSack, Tile, Player. (Andreea)
 - Game class is where the logic is implemented and some functionalities are: scoring according to the Scrabble rules (taking into consideration the double/triple letter/word), compute anagrams for a certain word, check if a word exists in DEX (if not, you can not place it on the board). (Andreea)
 - Socket Programming is the technology used for connecting the client (player) to the server: sending the objects (like board, player's current letters, anagrams etc.) via object Streams to the client, for updating the current status of the game, sincronizing client and server by proccesing the inputs and outputs. (Alin)
 - JavaFX for user interface: creating the tiles and letters and importing them in the project, creating the game via the server's output, in the end receiving all the features of the game in the terminal. (Alin)
