The game of Scrabble is implemented in Java in the following way:
 - We used OOP Principles for creating necessary classes for the game: Board, Letter, LetterHolder, LetterSack, Tile, Player. (Andreea)
 - Game class is where the logic is implemented and some functionalities are: scoring according to the Scrabble rules (taking into consideration the double/triple letter/word), compute anagrams for a certain word, check if a word exists in DEX (if not, you can not place it on the board). (Andreea)
 - Socket Programming is the technology used for connecting the client (player) to the server.
